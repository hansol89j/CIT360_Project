 Synchronized methods enable a simple strategy for preventing thread interference and memory consistency errors:
 if an object is visible to more than one thread, all reads or writes to that object's variables are done through synchronized methods. (An important exception:
 final fields, which cannot be modified after the object is constructed, can be safely read through non-synchronized methods, once the object is constructed).

        // and can be access by one thread at a time
